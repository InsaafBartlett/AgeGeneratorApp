# AgeGeneratorApp
The app i have designed and coded is called Age Generator.
The purpose of this app is for people to find out if any histrical/famous person died at their age.
The app has a very historical feel to it.
When you open the app you will see a background image of like pirate ships and scrolls.
![background image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1387807b-1ba6-47df-a62e-cfed67499338) 
I got the image from "Historic reproduction wallpaper (2018) Adelphi Paper Hangings. Available at: https://www.adelphipaperhangings.com/catalog/wallpapers/ (Accessed: 12 September 2024)." 
I felt this image will give the app a very historical feel.
I also chose to use different shades of orange as it matches with my background image.
I also specifically chose fonts that look a bit cursive but is bold, to give the app a scroll feel when typing and reading the data.
On the UI you will see the words "Enter your age" on top of a text block.
When you enter your age the relative data regarding your age will pop up down below in a light orange block.
The app is interesting because you can interact with it by typing in any ages and depending on the ages you can find out what historical or famous person died at that age, what they were famous for and how they died.
There are two buttons below the text block one that says "Generate" and another that says "Clear Text"
The "Generate" button produces your info regarding the age you input into the text block.
The "Clear Text" button clears any info that is being displayed in the text block and in the light orange textview block.
I added 11 histporical figures in my app.
Each from different fields and soemfrom the same field of profession.
The information in my app about the historical figures I got from the following websites:

The purpose of the app is to gain knowledge about former historical figures and tells more about what they did and how they died and we learn the ages they die as well i the process.
It is a fun way to learn about history.
I also did more research on When statements and learnt how to properly structure it through:

Using GitHub was also a mission but after doing through research and combining information from all these websites i worked my way through all the nooks and cranny's:

When it came to the design of the app I really thought everything through.
I gave every colour and font thorough thought because at first i was going for a brown theme but the colour did not match my background image that i had at first which was a big monacle in the background but it did not work because the font and color just did not go with the image.
I then changed it and thought of an orange theme and then i wanted my text to be orange as well but you could not see the words clearly.
Then I changed the text colour to white and made all my text blocks light orange and my buttons a darker orange.
I learnt how to change my font on my app from:
Font resources  :   android developers (no date) Android Developers. Available at: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/font-resource (Accessed: 12 September 2024). 

The app is meant to teach people about historical figures.
To teach us how age is just number but it carries lots of history.
When coding the app I added comments where I could.
I also learnt alot of what certain syntax errors mean such as "expecting an expression"
which is "Expression statement is An expression statement is an expression used in a place where a statement is expected. The expression is evaluated and its result is discarded — therefore, it makes sense only for expressions that have side effects, such as executing a function or updating a variable."(MozDevNet, Expression statement - javascript: MDN)
My goal for the app is that it firstly runs smoothly.
Secondly that people find it interesting, fun, inciteful and attractive.
Thirdly that lots of people gain knowledge from my app.
Making this small app has taught me to appreciate other apps because i have learnt so much about coding and UI design and Git and Android studio.
I am also now looking forward to learning more about app developement and coding and programming.
I also learnt that all my modules are kind of connected as i used inforomation from all my modules such as Programming,Principles of UI and UX design and then of course Mobile application developement.
